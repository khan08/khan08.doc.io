Introduction
============

Create a dask cluster using docker on AWS.
You need to use :py:meth:`cluster.ec2.launch`.

Quick Start
===========

Setup the einvironment. These setups are done only the first time:

* Install boto3 and paramiko
* Setup aws credential, ssh private key and default region.

Install requirements.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install boto3 paramiko

Create or edit ~/.aws/credentials and set the key and secret

.. code-block:: bash

   [default]
   aws_access_key_id='YOUR_KEY'
   aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET'

`Create key pair <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair>`_ from aws. After this step, you have a

* Key name
* Private key file

Create or edit ~/.aws/config and set the default region

.. code-block:: bash

   [default]
   region = us-east-1

Checkout the code for cluster launching from private repo.

.. code-block:: bash

   svn checkout https://weih.unfuddle.com/svn/weih_cheq/branches/daskec2/clusterAPI/cluster [local-path]

Run the launcher

.. code-block:: python

   from cluster import ec2
   manager = ec2.launch(n=1, instance_type='t2.micro',keyname=<YOUR_KEY_NAME>,key_filename=<YOUR_PEM_FILE>)

Browse to notebook when manager is ready. *https://manager.public_ip_address:8888*

To Do
=====
* Monitor in seperate thread
* Secure connections
* Automate launch notebook in browser
* Include spot request features
* Docker custom define features
